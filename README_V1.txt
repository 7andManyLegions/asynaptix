### **I. Core Platform Pillars & User Journeys**

The V1 application is built around four interconnected pillars that define the user experience.

#### **1. Agent Creation & Customization: The Power to Build**

This pillar provides a comprehensive and flexible suite of tools for builders of all skill levels to create sophisticated AI agents.

*   **Page: Agent Builder Hub (`/build`)**
    *   **Purpose:** The central starting point for agent creation.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Create with AI Assistant:** A guided flow where users can describe their desired agent in natural language, and the platform scaffolds the initial code.
        *   **Use a Framework:** A structured path for developers to build agents using industry-standard frameworks like **LangChain**, starting with a best-practice boilerplate template. This is designed to be extensible for other frameworks like LlamaIndex.
        *   **Start from Scratch:** A placeholder for future expert-level building, showing a clear product roadmap.

*   **Page: Agent Creation Form (`/build/new`)**
    *   **Purpose:** The main interface for configuring and programming an agent.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Dual Modes:** A toggle for "Simple Mode" (prompt-based creation) and "Developer Mode" (full code and parameter control).
        *   **Core Configuration:** Users can define an agent's name, description, and select the underlying AI model (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4).
        *   **Advanced Controls (Developer Mode):** Fine-tune model parameters like temperature, Top-K, and Top-P.
        *   **Memory Management:** A simple switch to enable or disable conversational memory.
        *   **Tool Integration:** A visual interface to browse and add available tools (like Calculator, Web Search) to the agent's capabilities.
        *   **Packaging & Saving:** Users can save drafts or "Package" the agent, which adds it to their personal collection.

#### **2. Agent Linking & Composition: The Core Innovation**

This is the platform's signature feature, enabling the creation of complex workflows by combining specialized agents.

*   **Page: Link Agents (`/link-agents`)**
    *   **Purpose:** To create new, powerful "meta-agents" by chaining existing ones together.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Agent Selection:** Users select two distinct agents from their collection to link.
        *   **AI Linking Assistant:** A Genkit-powered flow analyzes the two selected agents and provides a detailed suggestion on the most logical way to connect them, including data flow validation.
        *   **Generated Code:** The assistant produces the exact TypeScript code required to orchestrate the two agents.
        *   **Auto-Create & Package:** Users can give the new linked agent a name and description and automatically package it with a single click, or take the generated code back to the Agent Builder for further customization.

#### **3. Marketplace & Monetization: The Entrepreneur's Engine**

This pillar provides the complete framework for a self-sustaining economy, allowing creators to monetize their work.

*   **Page: Tools & Plugins (`/marketplace`)**
    *   **Purpose:** A marketplace for discovering and creating reusable tools that enhance agents.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Browse & Search:** A filterable list of all available tools (Baseline, Community, Premium).
        *   **AI-Assisted Tool Creation:** A powerful form where users can describe a tool in natural language, and the platform generates the full Genkit tool code, including Zod schemas.

*   **Page: My Agents (`/my-agents`)**
    *   **Purpose:** A personal dashboard for managing all user-created agents.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Agent Listing:** Displays all agents built or uploaded by the user.
        *   **Publishing Flow:** Each agent card contains a "Publish" button that opens a multi-step dialog. This flow integrates:
            *   **AI Security Scan:** An automated assessment of the agent's code and description to assign a security rating.
            *   **AI Price Suggestion:** A feature that suggests a monthly price based on the agent's complexity and value.
            *   **Pricing Model:** Users can choose to publish the agent as "Free" or "Paid."
        *   **Agent Uploading:** A fully functional dialog allows users to add agents they've built externally to the platform by providing a name and description.

*   **Page: Entrepreneurs (`/entrepreneurs`)**
    *   **Purpose:** A dashboard providing market intelligence to guide creators.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Market Demand:** A table showing trending search terms and user requests to highlight market gaps.
        *   **Top Grossing & Most Linked Agents:** Leaderboards showcasing which agents are most successful financially and as building blocks, inspiring new creation.

*   **Page: Billing (`/billing`)**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages the user's subscription and payment information.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   UI for viewing the current plan and upgrading to a "Pro" plan.
        *   UI for adding a payment method, explicitly noting the use of Stripe for security.
        *   A placeholder for billing history.

#### **4. Community & Discovery: The Social Fabric**

This pillar focuses on user interaction, discovery of community creations, and platform support.

*   **Page: Discover (`/discover`)**
    *   **Purpose:** The main entry point for browsing all community-published agents.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Advanced Filtering:** Users can filter agents by security rating, price, the framework they were built with, and minimum star rating.
        *   **Search:** A keyword search for agent names and descriptions.
        *   **Agent Cards:** Each agent is displayed with its key metadata: name, description, image, price, security badge, framework, and star rating.

*   **Page: Agent Detail (`/agent/[id]`)**
    *   **Purpose:** A dedicated page showcasing a single agent.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Detailed View:** Shows all agent information, including publisher details and version.
        *   **Purchase/Use CTA:** A context-aware button prompts users to "Purchase Agent" (for paid) or "Use Agent" (for free), which links to the run page.
        *   **Community Ratings:** Displays the agent's average star rating and allows logged-in users to submit their own 1-5 star rating.

*   **Page: Run Agent (`/agent/[id]/run`)**
    *   **Purpose:** A simulated chat interface to interact with and test an agent.

*   **Page: Request (`/requests`)**
    *   **Purpose:** A community "bounty board" for agent ideas.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Users can submit new agent ideas via a dialog form.
        *   The community can browse and upvote requested agents.
        *   A "Build It" button on each request links directly to the Agent Builder, pre-filling the agent's description to streamline development.
